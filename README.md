# Standardized-QPI-DHM-Evaluation-Protocol  

A Python-based GUI for evaluating the efficiency and validity of phase-reconstruction algorithms in **Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM)**.  
This repository provides a **standardized protocol** for Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI) evaluation, structured into four main modules (*nÃºcleos*) that cover background stability, global phase distortions, ground-truth comparisons, and computational complexity.

## Overview  

Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) enables quantitative phase imaging, but the reliability of reconstruction algorithms varies depending on the evaluation criteria. This repository defines a **benchmark protocol** and provides tools to assess the quality of reconstructed phase maps using standardized metrics.  

The protocol is organized into **four evaluation cores (nÃºcleos)**:  

1. Residual Background Phase Variance  
2. Global Phase Distortion Metrics  
3. Ground-Truth Comparisons  
4. Computational Complexity  

Additionally, a set of **test holograms** is included to benchmark performance across different types of samples.

## Nucleo I â€“ Residual Background Phase Variance  

Focuses on phase flatness in object-free regions of reconstructed phase images. Requires segmentation to isolate background regions.  

**Metrics:**  
- Standard deviation (STD) or Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)  
- Root Mean Square (RMS)  
- Peak-to-Valley (Pâ€“V) Value in background  
- Background phase tilt/curvature residuals (Legendre/Zernike coefficients)  
- Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the phase histogram  
- Spatial frequency content of background  
- Entropy of background phase map

##  Nucleo II â€“ Global Phase Distortion Metrics  

For samples without large empty regions. Evaluates distortions across the entire phase map.  

**Metrics:**  
- Maximumâ€“Minimum and Maximumâ€“Minimumâ€“Averageâ€“Î±-STD
- Global phase gradient 
- TSM (Total Sharpness Metric)  
- Phase curvature coefficients (low-order polynomial fitting)  
- Laplacian energy (Curvature Energy)  
- Spatial frequency content  
- Entropy of phase map  
- Sharpness/Contrast metrics  

---

##  Nucleo III â€“ Ground-Truth Comparisons  

Provides benchmark holograms and reference-based evaluation.  

**Metrics:**  
- Percent Error (PE) â€“ differences with manufacturer values in %  
- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)  
- pSNR (peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)  
- Self-consistency approaches:  
  - Double-exposure  
  - Conjugate wavefront reference  
  - Complex-field subtraction/multiplication for aberration-free reconstruction  

---

##  Nucleo IV â€“ Computational Complexity  

Estimates computational cost of each algorithm:  
- Operation counts  
- Hardware-dependent benchmarks  
- Execution time and memory profiling
